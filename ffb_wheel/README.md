# FFB Wheel Documentation

## Overview
This document serves as the comprehensive guide for the Force Feedback (FFB) Wheel module part of the DIY Modular Sim Racing Project. It includes details on assembly, software configuration, and usage to ensure an optimal sim racing experience.

## Design
The FFB Wheel is designed to provide realistic steering feedback based on in-game physics and interactions. The design is suitable for 3D printing, and all digital fabrication files are available in the `3d_files` folder of this repository.

## Hardware Requirements
List all components required for building the FFB Wheel. This includes motors, sensors, electronic controllers (like Arduino or similar microcontrollers), bearings, gears, and any specific tools needed for assembly.

## Software Setup
The FFB Wheel utilizes custom software that is uploaded using PlatformIO via Visual Studio Code. The following instructions will guide you through the setup process:

### Installing PlatformIO
1. If not already installed, download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open Visual Studio Code and go to the Extensions marketplace.
3. Search for and install the PlatformIO IDE extension.
4. Restart Visual Studio Code to ensure the PlatformIO extension is properly initialized.

### Compiling and Uploading the Code
1. Open your project directory in Visual Studio Code that contains the FFB Wheel software.
2. Use the PlatformIO sidebar to navigate to your project environment.
3. Modify the code as necessary in `src/main.cpp`.
4. Build the project by clicking the 'Build' button in the PlatformIO toolbar.
5. To upload the code to your microcontroller, click the 'Upload' button.

## Assembly Instructions
TODO: Provide detailed steps to assemble the FFB Wheel, including diagrams and photos to assist in the assembly process. Ensure each step is clear and includes tips for handling complex parts or configurations.

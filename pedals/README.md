# Pedals Module Documentation

## Overview
This document provides the technical documentation for the Pedals Module in the DIY Modular Sim Racing Project. It covers installation, configuration, and usage instructions to help users set up and modify the pedal system effectively.

### Based on Design
This module is based on the open-source design found at [SOSP Sim Racing Pedal Set](https://www.printables.com/model/323728-sosp-sim-racing-pedal-set). For additional resources, diagrams, and pictures, refer to the `docs` folder within this repository.

## Hardware Requirements
List all the hardware components needed to build the Pedals Module, including any specific models or specifications for parts like potentiometers, springs, and the pedal chassis.

## Software Setup
The code for the Pedals Module is compiled and uploaded using PlatformIO, an extension for Visual Studio Code. This section provides step-by-step instructions on setting up PlatformIO and compiling the project.

### Installing PlatformIO
1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open Visual Studio Code and install the PlatformIO extension from the marketplace.
3. Restart Visual Studio Code to complete the installation.

### Compiling and Uploading the Code
1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the PlatformIO icon on the sidebar and open the project environment.
3. Modify the source code in `src/main.cpp` as needed.
4. Build the project by clicking on the 'Build' button in the PlatformIO toolbar.
5. Upload the code to your Arduino by clicking on the 'Upload' button in the PlatformIO toolbar.

## Assembly Instructions
TODO: Detailed steps on how to assemble the Sequential Shifter after printing all the required parts. Include notes on any challenging steps or important considerations for assembly to ensure proper function.

### 3D Printing Instructions
TODO: Provide recommendations for printing settings such as layer height, infill percentage, and material type to ensure durability and functionality of the printed parts.

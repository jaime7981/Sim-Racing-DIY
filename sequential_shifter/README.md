# Sequential Shifter Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive technical documentation for the Sequential Shifter module, an essential component of the DIY Modular Sim Racing Project. It details the setup, installation, and operation of the shifter to enhance your sim racing experience.

## Design
The Sequential Shifter is entirely designed and developed in-house. All components necessary for assembly can be 3D printed, and the corresponding files are available in the `3d_files` folder within this repository.

## Hardware Requirements
Here you will list all the hardware components required to build the Sequential Shifter. Include specifics like type and size of screws, types of springs, and any electronic components like sensors or microcontrollers that are part of the build.

## Software Setup
The Sequential Shifter is managed through custom software that is uploaded using PlatformIO, integrated into Visual Studio Code. Below are the setup instructions:

### Installing PlatformIO
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you haven't already.
2. Within Visual Studio Code, go to the Extensions and search for PlatformIO IDE.
3. Install the PlatformIO extension and restart Visual Studio Code to complete the setup.

### Compiling and Uploading the Code
1. Open the Sequential Shifter project within Visual Studio Code by navigating to the project directory.
2. Access the PlatformIO interface from the sidebar and select the appropriate environment.
3. Make any necessary code adjustments in `src/main.cpp`.
4. Click the 'Build' button on the PlatformIO toolbar to compile the code.
5. Upload the firmware to your device by selecting the 'Upload' button.

## Assembly Instructions
TODO: Detailed steps on how to assemble the Sequential Shifter after printing all the required parts. Include notes on any challenging steps or important considerations for assembly to ensure proper function.

### 3D Printing Instructions
TODO: Provide recommendations for printing settings such as layer height, infill percentage, and material type to ensure durability and functionality of the printed parts.

# Sim Racing DIY

This project aims to provide modular DIY sim racing devices for enthusiasts who want to build their own racing setup.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the modules, simply navigate to the respective folder and follow the instructions provided in the documentation. Each module has its own PlatformIO project, allowing you to easily upload the code to your microcontroller, it is recomended to use platformIO in visual studio code.

## Modules

The project is divided into several modules, each representing a different sim racing device. Currently, the following modules are available:

### Force Feedback Wheel

- Folder: `ffb_wheel`
- Code: `ffb_wheel/src`
- Documentation: `force_feedback-wheel/docs`

The force feedback wheel module allows you to build your own force feedback steering wheel for an immersive racing experience.

### Pedals

- Folder: `pedals`
- Code: `pedals/src`
- Documentation: `pedals/docs`

The pedals module provides instructions and code for building your own sim racing pedals, ensuring accurate and responsive input during races.

### Sequential Shifter

- Folder: `sequential_shifter`
- Code: `sequential_shifter/src`
- Documentation: `sequential_shifter/docs`

The sequential shifter module enables you to construct a DIY sequential shifter, enhancing your control over gear shifting in racing games.
